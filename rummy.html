<h4 class="sub_head">Sort Function</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">In The Under 10 the cards are distributed randomly between all the opponents and appear in the fashion as shown below. You can easily arrange your cards by hitting the sort button. This feature sorts the cards according to their suits in increasing order of their ranks as shown.

<h4 class="sub_head">Declare</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">Sometimes when your opponent has a valid meld and you need to declare your cards.</p>

<h4 class="sub_head">Drop/Auto-Drop Function</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">As soon as players have been dealt, you may be able to drop a game if you’re displeased with the cards you’ve received. However, this will give you a bunch of undesirable points, so it needs to be a calculated risk! (Don’t try this on your first date!)
</p>

<h4 class="sub_head">Time-bound</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">The thing which separates it from offline rummy is that you cannot take your own sweet time for every move. This adds to the thrill of your skill!
</p>

<h4 class="sub_head">Discard a Card</h4>

<p class="cn_regular mt-2">Select the card that you want to discard by clicking on it and hit the discard icon that appears above the card. The discarded card will then move to the Open deck and your opponent may either pick this card or pick a card from Closed Deck in their next turn.
