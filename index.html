All the other cards in a player’s hand can be arranged in any type of sequence or set so long as they are valid according to the rules of rummy. When one player declares and shows their hand of cards, all other players must also do so and depending on what cards each player has in their hand, they are assigned points based on the standard rummy points system.</p>

										<!-- <div style="color: yellow; font-size: 19px">13 Card Rummy</div>
										<p style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-white mt-2 text-justify">The most popular variant, the 13 card rummy, has been given this name because each player is dealt 13 cards. It is considered the simplest and easiest form and that is why it is far more popular than any other variation of the rummy card game. Since this variation of rummy is played with just 13 cards, it is a swift and fast-paced rummy game that requires a high amount of concentration and flexibility in strategies. 13 card rummy is a truly exciting and adrenaline rushing experience for players. Moreover, the different types of gameplay modes in 13 card rummy make it highly challenging as well as a rewarding experience for players of all ages. Let’s look into the details of the different variations of 13 card rummy game.</p> -->

										<ul>
										<li style="color: yellow; font-size: 19px">Pool Rummy</li>
										<p style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-white mt-2 text-justify">In this variation of 13 card rummy, players pool in their buy-in value and this is set as the total value of the table. The player who wins this online rummy game takes home the entire amount at the table. This again has two modes of play, which are the 101 pool rummy and the 201 pool rummy. In the former mode, the player who reaches 101 points first, is eliminated from the rummy table. Similarly, in the latter version, this elimination threshold is 201 points. This makes pool rummy a highly competitive form of 13 card rummy game since all the players at the table are focused on indirectly eliminating the other by using cunning strategies.</p>

										<li style="color: yellow; font-size: 19px">Deals Rummy</li>
										<p style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-white mt-2 text-justify">This version of 13 card rummy begins with a decided number of rounds or deals, and at the end of which, the player with the highest number of chips wins the rummy game. For example, deals rummy can be played with a best of 2 or best of 3 deals, and at the end of the 2nd or 3rd deal respectively, the player with the highest number of chips, wins. In each deal, the winner receives chips from other players based on the value of cards in the hands of the losers. Finally, the player with the maximum number of chips among the other players wins the online rummy game.</p>

										<li style="color: yellow; font-size: 19px">Points Rummy</li>
										<p style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-white mt-2 text-justify">This is yet another highly popular and sought-after variant of 13 card rummy that most players love to play online. In points rummy, players play for a pre-decided value of points and the sum of all the points of the players at the table make up the total points. However, the player with zero points is ultimately declared the winner of the rummy game.</p>
									</ul>


										<!-- <li style="color: yellow; font-size: 19px">21 Card Rummy</li> -->
										<!-- <p style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-white mt-2 text-justify">The 21 card rummy variation is by far the most complex form of rummy game. Unlike 13 card rummy, in this variant, players are required to form a minimum of 3 pure sequences, 8 dublees, 3 tunnelas, a group of 8 jokers, and 2 marriage sets. For 21 card rummy, there are certain specific rules and terms that you need to know in order to win this online rummy game.</p> -->

										<!-- <p style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-white mt-2 text-justify">Jokers have a special place in the 21 card variant since there can be multiple jokers in a single rummy game. The printed joker, the cut joker, the upper joker, and the lower joker, are all important rummy cards needed to successfully declare and show in a game of 21 card rummy. For example, if the 5 of Spades is randomly chosen as the cut joker, then the 4 of Spades and the 6 of Spades become the lower joker and the upper joker respectively for that particular rummy game.</p> -->

										 <!-- <p style="font-size: 15px;" class="text-white mt-2 text-justify">Now, to win a game of 21 card rummy, players need to form dublees, tunnelas, and marriage hands/sets in addition to pure/impure sequences and sets. When playing 21 card rummy online, it is important to note that a dublee is a group of two cards of the same rank and suit, while a tunnela is a group of three cards of the same rank and suit.</p>  -->
